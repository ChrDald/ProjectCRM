*Add invalid index error handling WHEN delete or edit is selected but no row is selected in the table

***Make sure you cant put more characters in the description of the issue then you can
in the database

*Add menu bar functions

*Decide if the ids are INT or LONG (We have both now its confusing)

*If you want to be a try hard, when you create a sale, you check if you have enough product quantity first, then if you do you substract the sale quantity from
product quantity.

*Again try hard, if youre a manager and youre editing an employee's info, if you dont change the default **** 
value for password (for example if youre not changing the password) youre gonna update the password to ****
pretty big problem, need to set it so if the password is = **** then dont change it (also might wanna add some regex
for max characters and characters allowed?)

***When ADDING and EDITING in sales, 
the correct value for SUPPORT END is not working, its showing the same value as sale date

*In support, when selecting customer id, show that customers name/info in a tf or label below
do this for sales also

**in add sale, add a combo box(or something) below product name to ask for product quantity, and calculate
total price from price per unit and quantity in the text field total sale (maybe plus tax?)
